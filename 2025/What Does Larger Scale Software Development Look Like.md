# What Does Larger Scale Software Development Look Like?

## Overview
This video explains **enterprise software development workflows**, focusing on how a **team of approximately 10 developers** manages **code integration, testing, and deployment**.

---

## 1. Development Team Structure

Typical team composition:
- **Developers** (9-10 people)
- **Scrum Master**
- **Project Manager**
- **UI/UX Designers** (1-2 people)
- **Client**
  - Communicates end-user requirements to the development team
  - Provides progress updates and feedback in daily standup meetings

---

## 2. Development Workflow

The basic development flow:

1. **Client Requirements**
   - Client communicates feature requirements to the team
   - Team designs optimal solutions considering user needs

2. **Feature Implementation**
   - Small groups of 2-3 developers work together (pair/mob programming)
   - Create **feature branches in Git**
   - Develop, test, and submit code for review

3. **Code Review & Merge**
   - Other developers review **Pull Requests (PRs)**
   - Approved code is merged into `main` or `dev` branch

4. **Automated Deployment via CI/CD Pipeline**
   - `GitHub Actions` (or `CircleCI/Jenkins`) handles build, test, and deployment
   - **Deploy to Dev environment** → If stable, **promote to Staging**
   - Client and test users provide feedback

5. **Final Production Deployment**
   - After final checks, release to production

---

## 3. Version Control & Branching Strategy

Teams typically use the following branches:

### (1) Development Branch (`dev`)
- Integration branch for developers
- **Frequently updated daily for code integration**
- Automatically deployed to **AWS Dev environment** via `GitHub Actions`

### (2) Test/QA Branch (`staging`/`test`)
- **Testing completed features before production**
- **Client and QA engineers verify functionality**
- Conduct **load testing and smoke testing** to evaluate performance and durability

### (3) Production Branch (`main`)
- Merge `staging` code after testing
- Deploy to **Production environment** via `GitHub Actions`
- Uses **real production data**

---

## 4. Enterprise Deployment Strategy

Enterprise environments require more than simple merges to `main` - they need **complex AWS deployment strategies**.

1. **AWS Deployment** (Terraform & IaC)
   - Utilize **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Use `Terraform` to automatically provision **Lambda, OpenSearch, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront**, etc.
   - **Manual configuration is prohibited** (prevents environment drift)

2. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Redundancy across `AWS US-East` and `AWS US-West`
   - **Active-Active or Active-Passive** failover strategies
   - Must consider **data residency requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)**

---

## 5. Bug Response

Bug handling workflow in production:

### (1) Client Reports
- Clients or users report bugs
- Analyze using **error logs/monitoring tools (Datadog, Sentry)**

### (2) Rapid Response Methods

1. **Turn OFF Feature Flags**
   - **Immediately disable buggy features** to minimize impact
   - **Example:** Set relevant flag to `false` in `FeatureFlagDB`

2. **Rollback**
   - **Revert to previous Git version**
   - Change affected API's `Lambda` version to previous one

3. **Hotfix**
   - Create fix branch directly from `main` (`hotfix/xxxx`)
   - **Verify in test environment, then quickly release to production**
   - Subsequently **merge to `dev` and `staging` to maintain consistency**

---

## 6. Small vs. Large Scale Development

| **Aspect** | **Small Scale (Startup/Personal)** | **Large Scale (Enterprise)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Development Flow** | Direct push to `main` (immediate deploy) | 3-stage: `dev` → `staging` → `main` |
| **Deployment** | `Vercel/Netlify` (auto-deploy) | `AWS` + `Terraform` + `GitHub Actions` |
| **Testing** | Manual or simple E2E tests | **Unit/Integration/Load testing** |
| **Bug Response** | Direct fix & immediate deploy | **Feature Flags & Rollback capability** |
| **Operating Cost** | **Low** (serverless) | **High** (enterprise-grade) |

---

## 7. Summary

✅ **Enterprise development is complex but prioritizes scale and safety**  
✅ **CI/CD pipeline uses 3-stage deployment: `dev` → `staging` → `main`**  
✅ **Bug response uses `Feature Flags` and `Hotfixes` for rapid mitigation**  
✅ **Small-scale projects can use simpler approaches like `Next.js + Vercel`**

---

## Conclusion

Enterprise development differs from small-scale development by requiring **complex branching strategies, CI/CD, and infrastructure management**.

**Startups and personal projects can use simple development flows, but large-scale development requires ensuring safety while releasing.**
