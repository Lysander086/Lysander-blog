# Description
- This is a known issue in the Udemy tech team.
- Platform: Udemy web.

# Tried Solutions
- Android Emulator
    - Takes too much time.
- Web Browser Extensions
    - Can't find one.
- Ad Block Web Store Extension
    - The element ID is not the same, therefore when I switch to a new video, the play control exists.
- Use Mobile Phone at Hand to Play
    - Good to go.

- Most Recommended, Zoom in.
    - Use zoom to set the Udemy web to 50% level.
