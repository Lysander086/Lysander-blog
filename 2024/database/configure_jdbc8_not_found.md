# Local Maven Repository Setup and Publishing Guide
example error: Fixing the oracle jdbc8 local build error.
# General ideas 
- Configure the settings.xml file to include the local repo as the primary source of downloading jdbc8 dependencies. 
- Download the oracle jdbc8.jar from public maven cloud or oracle official websites. 
- publish the jdbc.jar to local maven repo using shell commands. 
- Then you can get a successful build. 

## Step-by-Step Procedures

### 1. Set Up Local Maven Repository

1. **Create `settings.xml` Configuration:**

   Create or modify your `settings.xml` file to include the local Maven repository configuration. This file is typically located in the `.m2` directory under your user's home directory.

   ```xml
   <repository>
       <id>local-maven-repo</id>
       <name>Local maven repo</name>
       <url>file://<path-to-your-m2-directory>/.m2/repository</url>
   </repository>
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-your-m2-directory>` with the appropriate path on your system.

### 2. Publish Artifact to Local Repository

1. **Create a Shell Script (`local_publish.sh`):**

   Create a shell script named `local_publish.sh` with the following content. This script installs the `ojdbc8.jar` file into your local Maven repository.

   ```sh 

   mvn install:install-file \
       -Dfile=/path/to/ojdbc8.jar \
       -DgroupId=oracle \
       -DartifactId=ojdbc8 \
       -Dversion=18.3.0.0 \
       -Dpackaging=jar \
       -DgeneratePom=true \
       -DlocalRepositoryPath=/path/to/your/.m2/repository
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/ojdbc8.jar` with the actual path to the `ojdbc8.jar` file and `/path/to/your/.m2/repository` with the actual path to your `.m2` repository directory.

2. **Run the Shell Script:**

   Execute the shell script to install the `ojdbc8.jar` file into your local Maven repository.

   ```sh
   source local_publish.sh
   ```

### Summary

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up a local Maven repository and published an artifact (`ojdbc8.jar`) to it. This allows you to manage dependencies locally without relying on external repositories.
